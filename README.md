## ‚è≥ Improvements With More Time

If given more time, here‚Äôs what I would add:

1. ‚úÖ **Backend Integration**  
   - Use Express.js + MongoDB or SQLite to store doctor data and bookings.
   - Implement authentication and protected routes for admin users.

2. ‚úÖ **Search & Filters**  
   - Better filtering using real-time fuzzy search (e.g., Fuse.js).
   - Add sorting by availability or specialization.

3. ‚úÖ **Pagination & Lazy Loading**  
   - Handle long lists of doctors with pagination or infinite scroll.

4. ‚úÖ **Better UI/UX**  
   - Use Tailwind CSS or Material UI for faster, scalable design.
   - Add transition animations for modals, cards, and feedback messages.

5. ‚úÖ **Form Enhancements**  
   - Add proper validations, error messages, and form reset logic.
   - Integrate calendar/time-picker components.

6. ‚úÖ **Deploy to Vercel or Netlify**  
   - Host app and use GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

## üß© Challenges Faced & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| **State Management Across Routes** | Used `useParams` and `fetch` to dynamically get doctor data based on URL ID. |
| **Dark Mode Switching** | Used CSS variables and `data-theme` attributes to handle theme styles cleanly. Persisted selection with `localStorage`. |
| **Countdown Redirect after Booking** | Used `useEffect` + `setTimeout` to show success and then redirect user smoothly after 10 seconds. |
| **Responsive Layout with CSS Only** | Avoided external libraries by using native CSS Grid and Flexbox to make the layout mobile-friendly. |
| **Mock API Handling** | Used static JSON to simulate real API without needing a backend for this assignment. |

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
